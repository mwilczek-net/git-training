# git reflog

> Holy Moly! Iâ€™ve just deleted a branch / tag / commit or screwed amending / rebasing / merging, etc. ðŸ’©

Good option to avoid panic in such situations is to use `git backup` before any potentially dangerous situations (described in [001 - aliases](../001%20-%20aliases)). Unfortunately, it canâ€™t cover all cases.

Good news: `git` remembers commits, even if there are not on any branch or tag. Bad news: git cleans those commits from time to time, but it depends on configuration.
